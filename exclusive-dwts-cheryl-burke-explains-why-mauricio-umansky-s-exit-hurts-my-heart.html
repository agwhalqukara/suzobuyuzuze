I thought also Sasha Farber choreographed a phenomenal Pasa Dobles but to really step it up, I think she needs to work on the in-betweens, the transition steps so it's not just about the execution of the step that is being taught to her but it's about how you come out of that step and go into the next step.&nbsp;</p><p id=e7NmE3ShG9 data-wc=31>You also don't want to just get through the routine, you want to live in the routine; Are you just learning the mechanics or are you really learning the dance itself?&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Cheryl Burke on Michael Strahan's guest judging on DTWS, and Rylee Arnold and Harry Jowsey's 'cute chemistry'" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ae90bca80833-170399em206696.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Cheryl Burke on Michael Strahan's guest judging on DTWS, and Rylee Arnold and Harry Jowsey's 'cute chemistry'" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Cheryl Burke on Michael Strahan's guest judging on DTWS, and Rylee Arnold and Harry Jowsey's 'cute chemistry'</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Dancing with the Stars: Cheryl Burke reveals why she was 'ugly crying' during premiere, who was 'overscored'" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Dancing with the Stars: Cheryl Burke reveals why she was 'ugly crying' during premiere, who was 'overscored'" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Dancing with the Stars: Cheryl Burke reveals why she was 'ugly crying' during premiere, who was 'overscored'</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h2>Harry Jowsey: Step away from social media&nbsp;</h2><p id=eaouRZpfKa data-wc=21><a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Rylee and Harry were great,</a> and I thought that with what he was given, it was the best dance he's done.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=erbOqZmGNlUb data-wc=85>His movement was a lot better and I think, in a way, being hidden with the makeup – and I want to give a beautiful shout out to the makeup department for doing an amazing job – helped Harry because whenever I see him dance, there's a moment of defeat and I think it's because he's reading comments on Instagram, and listening to the haters instead of just looking at the facts: You've never been in the bottom and so obviously, people are behind you.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1gX0-siri data-wc=25>I highly suggest that you either turn off the comments or put your accounts on hold, and stay present and focus on why you're here.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is a 'true' Argentine Tango?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eQYLykZw7a data-wc=16>You can really see the difference between the Argentine Tango that Pasha Pashkov choreographed versus Rylee.&nbsp;</p><p id=ed_7ugfaiH data-wc=64>Rylee's was almost a ballroom Tango with an inspiration from Argentine, but that's not the challenge. The challenge is to do an Argentine Tango dance, which is why when this dance was added onto the show many years ago, I decided to go to Argentina and take part in an Argentine tango group called Forever Tango because I didn't want to fake it anymore.</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Madixs Monster Night Tango Dancing with the Stars</a><p id=ey3iXD1qy3 data-wc=57>Pasha was not faking it. Pasha was doing authentic Argentine Tango and if you see the difference, there were less steps for the man than the woman, and they portrayed a story. Pasha loves body weight; when a man tells you, 'Give me body weight,' don't be scared to give them body weight, you're in good hands.&nbsp;</p><p id=eMro2W8876 data-wc=58>A lot of the pros could look at him when it comes to week six; he has been lacking content in his choreography and I wasn't very happy with it, but he just blew my mind this week. The dance was phenomenal, I got chills up and down my spine. He is truly making the ballroom community proud.&nbsp;</p><h2>No more Converse please</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=e9fiat3Z-4 data-wc=43>Charity's Converse sneakers affected her dance tremendously. The challenge with Jive is you need to have the tick, and in order for you to have the tick and the bounce that you need, it needs to come from your legs, feet and ankles.&nbsp;</p><p id=eEV9Dbpjfm data-wc=33>Artem Chigvintsev can be a drill sergeant all he wants, but with Converse on it's almost impossible to execute the technique of Jive. She looked like she looked flat footed the whole dance.&nbsp;</p><p id=ePTnS5qS4I9 data-wc=31></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
