Paris was like that too: she walks in to visit her sister, and the next thing you know, she’s Mother Theresa and setting up a foundation, and she also sees flaws and improvements in designs that professional fashion designer Zende can’t see.</p><p>Now, RJ is the second coming of Christ, a world famous influencer, and the heir apparent to Ridge as a designer despite having not drawn anything since he retired his crayon set. It doesn’t ingratiate these characters to us. I wish they would say less about them and just let them reveal their character by their deeds. Why do we have to have them spelled out to us it in such dull and overhyped ways?</p><p><span class=post-likes>19 Likes</span></p><p>He looks like he could pass for Ridge in another 50 years.

They already have characters doing that.
