He first became widely known as the baritenor in the group City High. He is also a highly successful songwriter and producer.</p><p>He was born Maurice Ryan Toby on November 26, 1976, in Willingboro, New Jersey. Toby's first encounter with fame happened at sixteen when he appeared in the 1993 film "Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit". He played the role of Ahmal James a member of the kids choir who would steal the show with their performance of "Joyful, Joyful", a song for which Toby wrote the rap part. After filming wrapped, Toby got in touch with Jazzy Jeff (of The Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff fame) and was subsequently invited to Philadelphia. Jeff and Ryan bonded and he was offered to sign to his Touch of Jazz Production Company. It was during that time that he started to write songs for <a href=# title="Will Smith Net Worth">Will Smith</a>, including the single "Miami", among other songs on his 1997 album "Big Willie Style."</p><p>Toby has penned singles for such artists as <a href=# title="Bobby Brown Net Worth">Bobby Brown</a>, Dru Hill, <a href=# title="Usher Net Worth">Usher</a>, Kevin Lyttle, Tyrese, Glenn Lewis, <a href=# title="Donell Jones Net Worth">Donell Jones</a> and Joe (singer). In 2001, he was asked to form a group by <a href=# title="Wyclef Jean Net Worth">Wyclef Jean</a>, and that's how City High was formed. Their debut eponymous album sold millions and was nominated for a Grammy Award. But after two years, City High disbanded in 2003, the year when Toby married City High bandmate <a href=# title="Claudette Ortiz Net Worth">Claudette Ortiz</a>. Following the disunion, he went to New Jersey, where Ryan connected with producers Vidal Davis and Andre Harris. The threesome collaborated on several songs for platinum plus recording artist Usher, out of which "Caught Up", "Superstar" and "Follow Me" made the 2004 album Confessions a chart-topping one. By 2009, Ryan divorced and found peace in Los Angeles, where he continued to pursue his music career of writing and producing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70qKloJ2iqHyzxcCnZK2nkq56r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sandy-hendrickse-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sandy Hendrickse Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./natural-beauty-stars-without-makeup.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Natural Beauty: Stars Without Makeup</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./came-to-a-conclusion.html>Came to a conclusion</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gigi-hadid-s-complete-dating-history-zayn-malik-more.html>Gigi Hadid's Complete Dating History: Zayn Malik, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rough-diamonds-is-available-to-watch-on-netflix.html>Is Rough Diamonds is Available to Watch on Netflix?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./liangelo-ball-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>LiAngelo Ball Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paden-bray.html>Paden Bray</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib.
