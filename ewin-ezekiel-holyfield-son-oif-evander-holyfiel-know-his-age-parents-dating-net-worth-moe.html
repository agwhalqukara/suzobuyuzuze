He was the first boxer to win the undisputed cruiserweight belt in the late <i>1980s</i> and the heavyweight championship in the early <i>1990</i>s.</p><p>Ewin Ezekiel Holyfield was born in<i> 1990</i> in the United States of America to Evander Holyfield and <strong>Paulette Bowen</strong>. However, his exact age is still under wraps. Moreover, he has a brother, <strong>Evander Holyfield Jr.</strong> (b. <i>1984</i>) (Boxer), and two sisters, <strong>Evette Ashley Holyfield</strong> (b. <i>1986</i>) and <strong>Ebonne Esheal Holyfield</strong> (b. <i>1989</i>).</p><h2>Is Ewin Ezekiel Holyfield Dating Anyone?</h2><p>Ewin Ezekiel Holyfield prefers to avoid social media's eye when it comes to his personal life. Moreover, there are no rumors also about his past and present relationship. So, from this, it's safe to assume he is living a single life like&nbsp;<a href=#>Matthias Schoenaerts</a>.</p><p>On the other hand, he is probably busy making his career life. That's why he may not have time for his love life right now. Also, he has not been spotted a girl in public places.</p><p>Besides this, the celebrity's kid does not remain active on social platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.&nbsp;Similarly, another celebrity's kid,<a href=#> Kyla Wayans</a>, also remains out of social platforms.</p><h2>Parent's (Evander And Paulette) Married Life</h2><p><a href=#>Evander Holyfield</a>&nbsp;and Paulette Bowen had not shared when and where they met for the first time. The couple dated for some years and eventually tied the knot on <i>May 17, 1985</i>, in the presence of their close ones.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/9/13/Evander_Holyfield_family_wife_Janice_Itson_1%20(1)-1631532119788.jpg><p>After some years of marriage, the husband-wife duo shared three kids. They were living a healthy married life, but unfortunately, after six years of marriage, they ended their bond in <i>1991</i>. The reason behind their separation was Evander's extra-marital affairs.</p><h2>Ewin Ezekiel Holyfield's Father, Evander Holyfield's Extra Affairs And Kids</h2><p>Evander Holyfield has dated many but married three of them. After the separation from Paulette, Evander was in a love relationship with<strong> La Brown</strong>, with whom he split up at the end of the <i>1990s</i>. Moreover, the pair shared a daughter,<strong> Emani Winter Holyfield</strong> (b. <i>1993</i>).</p><p>Then, the boxer began dating <strong>Janice Itson</strong> in <i>1994</i> and eventually got hitched on <i>October 4, 1996</i>. But, the duo got divorced in <i>July 2000</i>. Furthermore, the ex-partner welcomed a son, <strong>Elijah Jedidiah Holyfield</strong>, in <i>1998</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, Mr. Holyfield also dated <strong>Tamie Pettaway</strong>, with whom he shared a son, <i>Elijah Esaias Holyfield</i> (b. <i>1997</i>) (Professional American Football Player), and a daughter, <strong>Eden Eloise Holyfield</strong> (b. <i>1995</i>). However, the ex-pair had not shared when they started their bond and when they ended.</p><p>Evander was also linked as a boyfriend and girlfriend with<strong> Toi Irvin </strong>for a short time. The former sweetheart shared a son <strong>Eleazar Evan Holyfield</strong> who was born in <i>1997</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/9/13/download%20(5)%20(1)-1631531886759.jpg><p>Then, after many failed relationships, Holyfield again found his love in<strong> Candi Calvana Smith </strong>and exchanged the marriage vows in <i>2003</i> after dating for some years. Moreover, the couple welcomed a son,<strong> Eli Ethan Holyfield</strong>, in <i>2004</i>, and <strong>Eve Elizabeth Holyfield</strong>, a daughter, in <i>2005</i>.</p><p>But unfortunately, like his past relationship, this marriage also ended in divorce. And the husband-wife duo separated legally in <i>2012</i>. However, the reason behind their separation is not known.</p><h2>Ewin Ezekiel Holyfield's Net Worth</h2><p>Ewin Ezekiel Holyfield has not shared his profession, so it's pointless to discuss his net worth. He is probably enjoying his parent's net worth like many other celebrity kids.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2021/9/13/download%20(6)%20(1)-1631532225107.jpg><p>On the other hand, his father, Evander, has a <a href=# rel=nofollow>net worth </a>of<strong> $1 million</strong> as of early 2021. He earned all his wealth from his professional career. Besides this, he probably engages in other ventures also from where he increase his bank balance.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides this, 188 cm tall boxer makes a hefty amount of money from his endorsements also. Evander has been in the advertisements for <i>Zaxby's, Coca-Cola, Real Deal Grill cooking appliances,</i> etc.</p><p><i><strong>Stay Connected With&nbsp;</strong></i><a href=#><i><strong>Married Celeb</strong></i></a><i><strong>&nbsp;For More Interesting Articles!!!</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jp6uoqZdmsemt8ieo2agn6HGp7XEpZs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jacqueline-desmarais-family-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jacqueline Desmarais &amp;amp; Family Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dominic-west-net-worth-phone-number-house-address-wiki.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Dominic West Net Worth Phone Number, House Address, Wiki</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./came-to-a-conclusion.html>Came to a conclusion</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gigi-hadid-s-complete-dating-history-zayn-malik-more.html>Gigi Hadid's Complete Dating History: Zayn Malik, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rough-diamonds-is-available-to-watch-on-netflix.html>Is Rough Diamonds is Available to Watch on Netflix?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./liangelo-ball-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>LiAngelo Ball Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paden-bray.html>Paden Bray</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib.
