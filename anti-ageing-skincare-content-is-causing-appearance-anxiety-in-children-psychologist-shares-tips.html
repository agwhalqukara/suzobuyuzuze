All of this contributes to a toxic culture of unrealistic beauty standards and pressures."</p><p id=e8XdBr5vtuv data-wc=22>Below, Dr Phillippa has shared some helpful tips on how parents can chat with their children about skincare to foster positive self-esteem…</p><h2><strong>How to talk to your child about skincare…</strong></h2><h3><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Encourage self-trust</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p id=eZWDt3o6osH data-wc=19>Emphasize that real beauty comes from being authentic and true to oneself, rather than following trends dictated by others.</p><h3><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Foster critical thinking</strong></h3><p id=eCuD19QBoHz data-wc=49>Help your children develop a critical eye when it comes to skincare advertising, especially on social media. Encourage them to question why certain products are being promoted and whether they genuinely need them at their age. Teach them to make informed decisions rather than being swayed by flashy ads.</p><h3><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Emphasise body appreciation</strong></h3><p id=eV1nKBixAbv data-wc=45>Shift the focus from appearance to function when discussing skin. Highlight the importance of celebrating their skin for what it does (e.g. protecting them from germs, allowing them to feel sensations), rather than solely focusing on its appearance. Body appreciation will boost their body confidence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e994e178616c-girl-makeup.jpg><h3><strong>4. Encourage creativity</strong></h3><p id=ePCbrA8bXN data-wc=39>Support your children in experimenting with their appearance in creative ways. Whether it's trying out face paint for fun events or exploring unique accessories, encourage them to embrace their individuality and express themselves creatively instead of just following trends.</p><h3><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Guide social media use</strong></h3><p id=ekSq0fyUGlv data-wc=32>Help your children curate their social media feeds by following accounts that promote positivity and self-acceptance. Encourage them to unfollow accounts that perpetuate unrealistic beauty standards or content unsuitable for their age.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Child online safety helplines and websites: find help with NSPCC, Childline and more" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/5fa352c0d2ff-helplines-logo.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Child online safety helplines and websites: find help with NSPCC, Childline and more" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Child online safety helplines and websites: find help with NSPCC, Childline and more</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Mother-of-two Meghan Markle issues warning about child online safety" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/13955b4dc159-meghan-markle.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Mother-of-two Meghan Markle issues warning about child online safety" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Mother-of-two Meghan Markle issues warning about child online safety</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><h3><strong>6. Address comparisons</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p id=eYhWSkhtmFS data-wc=39>Discuss with your children the potential pitfalls of comparing themselves to idealised images on social media. Remind them that these images often present an unrealistic standard of beauty and encourage them to focus on their unique qualities and strengths.</p><h3><strong>7. Normalise skin changes</strong></h3><p id=eCzl-i4f9e data-wc=34>Assure your children that spots and skin changes are a normal part of growing up and do not define their worth. Encourage open communication about skincare concerns and offer support and guidance when needed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f1bb53231800-mum-daughter-masks.jpg><h3><strong>8. Promote skincare education</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p id=eRahkptsBkm data-wc=37>Equip your children with knowledge about skincare ingredients and their effects on the skin. Encourage them to learn about what they're putting on their faces to make informed choices that align with their skin type and age.</p><h3><strong>9. Prioritise inner beauty</strong></h3><p id=eySTIEYX4p data-wc=34>Emphasise the importance of inner qualities such as kindness, empathy, and confidence over outward appearance. Encourage your children to cultivate these qualities and surround themselves with people who value them for who they are.</p><h3><strong>10. Practice self-care</strong></h3><p id=ehb96bIzLS data-wc=42>Teach your children the importance of self-care for overall well-being. Encourage them to engage in activities that make them feel good both inside and out, whether it's spending time outdoors, practising mindfulness, journaling, taking a nap, or engaging in hobbies they enjoy.</p><p id=eUoiRLBCCML- data-wc=48></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
