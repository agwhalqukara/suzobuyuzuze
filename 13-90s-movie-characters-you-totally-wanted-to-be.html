Some of them were completely awful human beings — for example, Kathryn Merteuil of <i>Cruel Intentions </i>— but nonetheless had things that every '90s girl wanted. Others didn't have it quite so easy in terms of life situation, but made up for it with enviable intelligence (like Clarice Starling in <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>) or remarkable badassery (like Mathilda in <i>Leon the Professional</i>). Even more <a href=# class=T3D>enviable '90s movie characters</a> had neither amazing material possessions nor personal qualities, but <i>did</i> have two hours' worth of onscreen romance with a hunky guy in whitewashed jeans. And sometimes that was enough to make a '90s girl turn green with jealousy.</p><p>There were also some male <a href=# class=T3D>characters from '90s movies</a> whose shoes I'd be more than glad to step into. Richie Rich? That kid had it made. Bodhi in <i>Point Break</i> got to surf <i>and</i> rob banks. And Lestat from<i> Interview with the Vampire </i>was the only supernatural villain who could rock a blonde ponytail. So here are some movie characters from the 1990s who, for one reason or another, are still totally enviable in 2016.</p><h3>1. Melanie And Allyson, <i>Passport To Paris</i></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Mary-Kate and Ashley played twins whose parents paid for them to go stay with their esteemed ambassador grandfather at his mansion in Paris. The girls proceeded to meet two charming French boys who drove them around the City of Lights on their mopeds. Yes, please.</p><h3>2. Rose, <i>Titanic</i></h3><p>I'm pretty sure that literally every girl in the '90s wanted to be Rose. She had the love affair of a lifetime with Jack Dawson and then survived the sinking of the Titanic to live a long, full life until she passed away peacefully in her bed at the age of 101.</p><h3>3. Cher, <i>Clueless</i></h3><p>Cher was the all-time enviable Beverly Hills girl, and she got to kiss a '90s Paul Rudd — even if it <i>was</i> a little weird that he was supposed to be her step brother.</p><h3>4. Kevin, <i>Home Alone</i></h3><p>Macaulay Culkin's character had a freakin' awesome house (which is probably why he took such extreme measure to protect it). And then he got to lounge around in a suite in the Plaza in <i>Home Alone 2</i>. So much jealousy.</p><h3>5. Princess Jasmine, <i>Aladdin</i></h3><p>Yes, Princess Jasmine was an oppressed female character. But she also had a pet tiger and got to go on a flying carpet, so...</p><h3>6. Zenon, <i>Zenon: Girl Of The 21st Century</i></h3><p>Who wouldn't want to live in space? Especially when you have tight friends and even tighter fashion...</p><h3>7. Gage, <i>Indecent Proposal</i></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>John Gage was a shrewd, dishonest man who was morally bankrupt despite of all his physical riches. But, like, we're talking about a <i>lot </i>of riches. Plus, it'd be pretty awesome to be Robert Redford for a day.</p><h3>8. Annie And Hallie, <i>The Parent Trap</i></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Imagine that you have a dad who's a vineyard owner in California, a mom who's a fashion designer in London, <i>and</i> a newly discovered twin. Nice.</p><h3>9. Dr. Sattler, <i>Jurassic Park</i></h3><p>She was brilliant, kindhearted, and rocked a collared shirt and khakis like nobody's business.</p><h3>10. Vivian, <i>Pretty Woman</i></h3><p>It's a pretty drastic upgrade to go from being an escort to being the love interest of a dashing businessman played by Richard Gere.</p><h3>11. Duncan, <i>My Date With The President's Daughter</i></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Who wouldn't want to go on a date with the child of the POTUS? Although, this movie admittedly had the major flaw that Duncan didn't recognize Hallie as the offspring of the leader of the free world when he met her.</p><h3>12. Kat, <i>10 Things I Hate About You</i></h3><p>Not only did Kat get to date Heath Ledger, but she also had one of the best angsty teenage monologues of all time.</p><h3>13. Torrance, <i>Bring It On</i></h3><p>She was pretty, she was cool, and she dominated her school. Don't pretend you weren't jealous of Kirsten Dunst's character.</p><p>So many characters, so many opportunities to be envious. But it's worth noting that you have things that none of these characters did. Like an iPhone, and Chobani, and <i>Downton Abbey.</i> So even though the lives of many '90s movies characters were pretty bitchin', so is yours.</p><p><i>Images: Buena Vista (3), </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Giphy</i></a><i> (9), Warner Bros, Paramount</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxygJNram1lYWh6enzSZqSorpmaeqS0wKuYnKyVp8Buxc6uZK2npJa5rcWMsJinrJWZerW7jJuc</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./demi-bagby-biography-age-wiki-net-worth-bio-height-boyfriend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Demi Bagby Biography | Age, Wiki, Net worth, Bio, Height, Boyfriend?|</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-ryan-wigglesworth-net-worth-2024-bio-age-height-family-music-style-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is Ryan Wigglesworth Net Worth 2024: Bio, Age, Height, Family, Music Style, And More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./came-to-a-conclusion.html>Came to a conclusion</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gigi-hadid-s-complete-dating-history-zayn-malik-more.html>Gigi Hadid's Complete Dating History: Zayn Malik, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rough-diamonds-is-available-to-watch-on-netflix.html>Is Rough Diamonds is Available to Watch on Netflix?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./liangelo-ball-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>LiAngelo Ball Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paden-bray.html>Paden Bray</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib.
