Naturally, textured hair is the most common type of hair, and it is the one that most people have.</p><p>The texture of your natural hair will depend on your ethnicity and genetics.</p><p>Textured hairstyles are very versatile. You can wear them to work, for a night out or even for a casual day at home. This hairstyle suits all face shapes, especially round faces, which look better with short hair.</p><p>To get this hairstyle, you need to find a good stylist who handles textured hair well. The stylist should also be experienced enough to ensure that the style lasts long and does not break off easily.</p><p>They should also know how to blow dry your natural textured hair properly to maintain its shape throughout the day.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Beach Waves</strong></h2><p>Beach waves are an easy hairstyle to create. The look is about the texture, which can be achieved using a curling or flat iron.</p><p>If you have naturally wavy hair, then you’re in luck! If your hair is straight or curly, it’s time to break out the product and ask your stylist for beach waves.</p><p>Start with the bottom of your hair and work your way up to get beachy curls that hit different lengths on each side of your head. To get this style, use a 1-inch curling iron with a clamp to create loose waves.</p><p>A flat iron can also be used to create this look. That will give it extra lift as well as give it some extra body and volume too! Toss dry shampoo on your roots before running the flat iron from root to tip over damp hair.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Shag Hairstyle</strong></h2><p>This is a very popular hairstyle among ladies. This hairstyle has been around for a long time and is still very popular today.
