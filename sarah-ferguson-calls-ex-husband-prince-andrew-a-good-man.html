Beatrice, 34, shares daughter Sienna, 19 months, with husband <strong>Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi</strong>, while Eugenie, 33, shares son August, 2, with husband <a href=#><strong>Jack Brooksbank</strong></a>. In January, Eugenie announced that she and the businessman, 36, are expecting their second child.</p><p>Despite their split, Ferguson and Andrew still live together in Windsor. After <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>‘s death, they took in two of the late monarch’s beloved corgis.</p><p>Andrew stepped back from public royal duties in late 2019 after <strong>Virginia Giuffre</strong> came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct, which prompted questions about the prince’s ties to Epstein. The financier was arrested on federal charges for sex trafficking minors in July 2019 and died by suicide in his jail cell one month later.</p><p>“I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever,” Andrew said of Giuffre in November 2019. “It just never happened.”</p><p>In August 2021, Giuffre filed a lawsuit against Andrew, accusing him of raping and sexually abusing her when she was 17. The prince later formally denied the allegations and demanded a jury trial.</p><p>Weeks before Andrew was set to be deposed, he and Giuffre <a href=#>settled out of court for an undisclosed sum</a>. A letter was also submitted to the United States District Court in New York City, explaining that the parties would file a stipulation dismissing the case within 30 days.</p><p>“Prince Andrew intends to make a substantial donation to Ms. Giuffre’s charity in support of victims’ rights,” read the February 2022 document. “Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms. Giuffre’s character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks.”</p><p>One month earlier, <a href=#>Andrew was stripped of all his military titles and patronages</a>. “With The Queen’s approval and agreement, The Duke of York’s military affiliations and Royal patronages have been returned to The Queen,” Buckingham Palace announced in a January 2022 statement. “The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Andrew is the second youngest child of Elizabeth and the late <a href=#>Prince Philip</a>, whose other children are <a href=#><strong>King Charles III</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Princess Anne</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Prince Edward</strong></a>. The Britannia Royal Naval College graduate is eighth in line to the throne of England following his mother’s September 2022 death.</p><p>Two months after Elizabeth’s passing, Charles, 74, requested that Anne, 72, and Edward, 59, be <a href=#>added to the list of counselors of state who can stand in for him</a> at official functions since Andrew and <a href=#><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a> were no longer working royals.</p><p>If you or anyone you know has been sexually abused, call the <a href=#>National Sexual Assault Hotline</a> at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673). A trained staff member will provide confidential, judgment-free support as well as local resources to assist in healing, recovering and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmaKWtW6yxKuerqufo3qkrculqmadqGK1tr%2FBmqWdZaCntq%2BvxGaYp5yimsRurYygpqicXaKur3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./update-origin-of-earthquake-traced-to-wundanyi.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>UPDATE: Origin Of Earthquake Traced To Wundanyi</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./list-of-top-shipping-companies-in-south-africa.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>List of top shipping companies in South Africa</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./came-to-a-conclusion.html>Came to a conclusion</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./gigi-hadid-s-complete-dating-history-zayn-malik-more.html>Gigi Hadid's Complete Dating History: Zayn Malik, More</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-rough-diamonds-is-available-to-watch-on-netflix.html>Is Rough Diamonds is Available to Watch on Netflix?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./liangelo-ball-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html>LiAngelo Ball Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./paden-bray.html>Paden Bray</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 RiffVib.
