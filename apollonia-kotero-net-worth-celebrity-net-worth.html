In April 2022, Apollonia spoke to "People" magazine about the last time she saw Prince, at a party a few weeks before his death, stating, "He was a little quiet and he didn't look the same. Out of the blue he said, 'Some people think I look too thin,' but then he shrugged his shoulders. When we said goodbye, I told him I loved him, and he told me, 'I love you too.'" Kotero said that she was "severely depressed" after Prince's death and that therapy helped her deal with her grief. She said of her dear friend, "Prince gave me beautiful gifts. He is my legacy.
