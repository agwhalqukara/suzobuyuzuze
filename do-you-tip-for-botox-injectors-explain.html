But what about tipping for aesthetic treatments like Botox? Some say to do it, while others feel it is unnecessary — and even frowned upon. Curious about the real deal, we tapped the experts to determine when to tip your Botox injector and exactly how much.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-do-you-have-to-tip-for-botox></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Do You Have to Tip for Botox?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's no hard and fast rule when it comes to tipping your Botox injector if the treatment is done outside of a dermatologist or plastic surgeon's office (most doctors won't accept a tip). While some patients feel it is necessary to tip, others don't. According to Masha Amelina the beauty industry includes many services and professionals where clients are expected to tip. "However, it's well-known that medical professionals should not accept tips."</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just because it may not be commonplace to tip your Botox injector like you do your manicurist, it happens. Orla Stewart says the concept of medical spas inherently confuses patients on tipping etiquette. "These institutions exist to provide medical treatments in a pleasant, spa-like setting where you would normally tip a masseuse or hairstylist," Stewart says. But instead of getting a blowout, you are getting Botox.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Doctors typically own and operate medspas, but they aren't the person administering the injections, which is often a nurse practitioner or physician's assistant. And that creates a gray area on tipping.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-much-to-tip></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Much to Tip</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you choose to tip your injector, it should be between 10 and 20 percent of the total bill, which is standard in the beauty industry. But don't be offended if your injector also refuses your offer. Amelina says she politely declines tips from her clients. "Tipping can be viewed as a bribe," she explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although Stewart says some patients at the medi-spa where she works tip as they appreciate the care and attention they receive, it's not necessary. "Patients will sometimes leave tips as gratitude for the amount of physical exertion they see required for treatments such as laser hair removal or touch-up procedures," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But, unlike Amelina's stance on Botox tipping, Stewart says it is not generally rejected by the injector, "just like you would not refuse a kind gesture or a gift someone put great thought into giving you. It would seem awkward to try to refuse it."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-not-to-tip></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When Not to Tip</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you're unhappy with your Botox experience or the results, it's okay not to tip your provider. And if a dermatologist or plastic surgeon injects your Botox, you'll be hard-pressed to find a board-certified doctor who will accept a tip since they are not expected. Most medically trained professionals and physicians deem tipping unethical.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since Botox is already pretty pricey, adding 10 or 20 percent of that to the final bill may have you spending more than you had hoped. So while adding a tip to your bill may seem like a nice idea, don't think twice about it if it's not within your budget. "At the end of the day, the patient is receiving a medical treatment for which there is no notion of tipping," Stewart adds.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If a tip isn't in the cards but you're happy with your Botox, other acts of kindness are equally appreciated. "Small gifts and thank you cards are acceptable, appreciated and common," Amelina says. "Handwritten notes are special, too. I feel grateful to be able to improve someone's life, even on a small scale. And, of course, reviews are priceless! That keeps the business growing, and they matter so much."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-bottom-line></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Bottom Line</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's no right or wrong way to go about tipping. In general, if you're feeling generous and want to give your injector a little something extra to show your appreciation, then by all means, do it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, while tips are always appreciated but never expected, Stewart makes it a point that her practitioners never treat patients partially, whether they never tip, tip once, or always tip.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57w6hksqelYsGqvIyfpqtlkqTBsMSMoqWjnZOpvLO%2FjJ6vqaSRnrtug5RqaGlwZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jor-dan-armstrong-releases-l-h-u-y-let-him-use-ya-and-teases-upcoming-projects-exclusive.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>JorDan Armstrong Releases L.H.U.Y.
