It was a political show with politicians and political pundits as guests. Between 2002 and 2013, he hosted a separate but somewhat similar show, <i>The Chris Matthews Show</i> on NBC. This was a political roundtable with different journalists at the same time and Matthews acting as the moderator.</p><p class=align-left>He covered every major U.S. election and was expected to stay on the current one, with his retirement coming after it was concluded in November.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/1e0148d28bd83d2e.jpg><h3>Controversies</h3><p class=align-left>Over recent years, there have been a number of negative stories emerging about him. In 2017, there were <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">details about a settlement</a> from 1999 revolving around inappropriate comments he made about his female producer in front of their coworkers.</p><p class=align-left>In February, Laura Bassett, a political journalist, alleged that he had made <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">inappropriate comments</a> towards her in October 2016, allegedly asking:</p>Why haven’t I fallen in love with you yet? Keep putting makeup on her, I’ll fall in love with her.<p class=align-left>She claims this interaction happened before she went on the show to comment about the sexual harassment allegations against Donald Trump.</p><p class=align-left>Also, in February, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">came under fire</a> for comparing the presidential candidate Bernie Sanders’ win in the 2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses to Nazi Germany’s occupation of France in 1940 during World War 2. The comparison infuriated many since some members of Sanders’ family were killed by the Nazis in the holocaust. He later <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">issued an apology</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/9c064f9c000fb385.jpg><h3>Chris Matthews retirement</h3><p class=align-left>He was expected to retire in November 2020 after the presidential election was completed. However, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">on March 2nd, 2020</a>, he announced he was leaving very abruptly while on air. He said the following:</p>I am retiring. This is the last Hardball on MSNBC … The younger generations ... are improving the workplace, we are talking here about better standards than we grew up with, fair standards. A lot of it has to do with how we talk to each other, compliments on a woman’s appearance that some men — including me — might have once incorrectly thought were okay were never okay. Not then and certainly not today...<p class=align-left>This statement was followed immediately with a commercial break and Chris Matthews retiring from the show with a different host in his place right after the break.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/57bbea0300d40603.jpg><h3>Family</h3><p class=align-left>Chris Matthews wife is the former reporter <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kathleen Matthews</a> (née Cunningham) since 1980.
