But for Austin specifically, it‚Äôs hard to ‚Äúmaintain an image‚Äù when it has already been soiled by years of controversy and scandals, with 2021 and 2022 being <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">particularly bad</a> ones.</p><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true>It‚Äôs not like Catherine doesn‚Äôt get her own share of hate. But Austin, to netizens, is on another level. When, some months ago, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a Redditor OP </a>who‚Äôd just found out about Austin McBroom and quickly came across the cheating rumors, asked the rest of the community whether they had heard of him, the most upvoted comment read:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by<a href=#>u/idubbzjoji</a> from discussion<a href=#></a><br>in<a href=#>LAinfluencersnark</a></figure><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=true>Indeed, the YouTube coverage of the ACE family‚Äôs ups and downs ‚Äì mostly the downs ‚Äì is endless. So are the media articles, and forum posts.

The one who was the first to blow the whistle on Austin‚Äôs creeping around models‚Äô DMs was Laura Lux:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=619 data-injectable=true><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/1OhIbVhwTQ</a></p>‚Äî laura lux ü¶ñü™ê (@darthlux) <a href=#>January 2, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>To which, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jamie Lyn</a>, another model, replied with her own screenshot of the exact same message. Long before this, multiple people had called out Austin for cheating on his wife, one having been none other than <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jake Paul</a>, and another was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tana Mongeau</a>. As for the scams Austin has been accused of, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the H3 Podcast</a> did a deep dive into some of the allegations. They even made a comparison between McBroom and ‚Äú<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Fyre Festival guy</a>.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=605 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true>One could also argue that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the very picture Austin used to share</a> his own polished take <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on the divorce</a> was a manipulation strategy. The picture he used was none other than one taken on the day he proposed to his now ex-partner, hence associated with a deeply emotional memory that would be sure to poke most women where they are still sore so soon after a separation. His statement also made it seem as if he was the one who made the decision, while Catherine portrays it as a mutual agreement. From the comments alone, one can see how netizens‚Äô dislike for Austin runs much deeper than for Catherine.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>Another present reason people are taking hits at Austin is due to his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‚Äúcringe‚Äù Snapchat stories</a>. That, frankly, takes on the appearance of implicit damage control gone wrong. Some of the snaps documented how, on the day he was supposed to move out of the house, Austin fell sick, and ended up not leaving just yet.</p><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>No matter how serious and a man of God Austin tries to present himself as, it appears people aren‚Äôt taking him as such, choosing instead to satirize him with their own <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> posts.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@yviain href=#>@yviain</a><p>please dont give austin anymore snap gems</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Nia Ivy" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Nia Ivy</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@realfreeplace href=#>@realfreeplace</a><p>austin snap vids too funny he yappinn <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> <a title=funny href=#>#funny</a> <a title=memes href=#>#memes</a> <a title=humor href=#>#humor</a> <a title=floptok href=#>#floptok</a> <a title=floperaüòòüíÖ href=#>#floperaüòòüíÖ</a> <a title=whenhe href=#>#whenhe</a> <a title=girls href=#>#girls</a> <a title=memegod href=#>#memegod</a> <a title=real href=#>#real</a> <a title=relatable href=#>#relatable</a> <a title=reaction href=#>#reaction</a> <a title=funnyvideos href=#>#funnyvideos</a> <a title=realvideos href=#>#realvideos</a> <a title=memestiktok href=#>#memestiktok</a> <a title=tiktok href=#>#tiktok</a> <a title=austinmcbroom href=#>#austinmcbroom</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - realshi" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì realshi</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><a title=@bffspod href=#>@bffspod</a><p>Austin McBroom is making some weird Tik Toks and @Josh Richards had to get into the parody business</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - BFFs Pod" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì BFFs Pod</a></figure><p data-characters=544 data-current-count=544 data-injectable=true>In one video, Austin also announced that he intended to move out.

And we didn‚Äôt even need to get into what Shyla Walker, Austin‚Äôs ex-sister-in-law, had to say about the McBrooms. She denominated family vlogging to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Insider</a> as ‚Äúperformative,‚Äù and that‚Äôs exactly what it is. A few parts that should‚Äôve been edited out of the ACE family vlogs but weren‚Äôt by mistake are further proof of this.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=617 data-injectable=false>If the Internet dislikes Austin, they dislike Landon McBroom just as much, if not more.
