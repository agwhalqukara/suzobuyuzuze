But Armie set out to make his own fortune in Hollywood, landing roles in movies including "The Social Network," "J. Edgar," "The Lone Ranger," and "Call Me by Your Name." By 2019, he had built a net worth of $16 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But in 2021, multiple women brought the hammer down on Armie. It started with a woman named Effie, who alleged that he had raped and physically assaulted her, per <a href=#>USA Today</a>. Other women shared screenshots of messages describing cannibalistic fantasies that were purportedly from Armie. "He said to me he wants to break my rib and barbecue and eat it," his ex, Courtney Vucekovich, claimed to&nbsp;<a href=#>Page Six</a>.</p><p>Effie ultimately lost her criminal case against Armie because there wasn't enough evidence to bring charges against the actor, but his career still hit the skids. He was dropped from the movies "Shotgun Wedding," "The Offer," and "Billion Dollar Spy," per <a href=#>Variety</a>.&nbsp;By 2022, he had found work elsewhere, with <a href=#>People</a> reporting that he had become a timeshare salesman in the Caymans. "His dad won't help him anymore and he's been cut off, so he got to work," a source alleged.&nbsp;His <a href=#>net worth</a> also took a massive hit and is $100,000, as of this writing.</p><p>If you or someone you know is dealing with domestic abuse, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1−800−799−7233.
